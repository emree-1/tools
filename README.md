# Tools
 Some tools that I developped...

- [**vol_ps_summary**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/volatility3-process-summary/) : summarizer for `Volatility 3`'s `PsList` and `PsScan` modules, providing a quick overview and analysis capabilities of process data extracted from memory captures.
- [**b64find**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/b64-find/) : search and decode base64-encoded values based on a given prefix. 
- [**KBDscan**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/KBDscan/) : analyze USB traffic in `.pcap` files and detect potential USB keyboards based on USB HID specifications.
