# Tools
 Some tools that I developped...

- [**vol_ps_summary**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/volatility3-process-summary/): summarizer for `Volatility 3`'s `PsList` and `PsScan` modules, providing a quick overview and analysis capabilities of process data extracted from memory captures.
- [**b64find**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/b64-find/): search and decode base64-encoded values based on a given prefix. 
- [**KBDscan**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/KBDscan/): analyze USB traffic in `.pcap` files and detect potential USB keyboards based on USB HID specifications.
- [**KBDtrace**](https://emree-1.github.io/KBDtrace): script that converts USB HID keyboard reports into readable keystrokes. Perfect for forensic analysis or debugging USB devices. (Original code is from [TeamRocketIst](https://github.com/TeamRocketIst/ctf-usb-keyboard-parser/blob/master/usbkeyboard.py))
- [**KeyFind**](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/KeyFind/): variants-based keyword search script designed for string data analysis, supporting formats like `base64`, `hex`, and `Caesar cipher`.
